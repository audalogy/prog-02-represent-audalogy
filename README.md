# PROG 02: Represent!

Caucus, Primary, Debate, Delegates, Issues! How can we find the signal in all the noise and hype as we approach the 2016 US Presidential Election? 

I have been tasked to help design a groundbreaking mobile and smartwatch application to deliver facts to voters on the go.

This is phase two of a three phase assignment.
